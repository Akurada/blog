<p>My name is Abhinav Kurada. I am an incoming Egleston Scholar at Columbia University.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of high school, I have become interested in biomedical engineering, pharmaceuticals, and the startup world.  I am interested in projects, inventions, and areas where business and science coexist to help further our world.</p>

<p>I've represented the United States at the International Geography Olympiad, co-founded Boston's first 24 hour high school hackathon, worked in labs at leading Ivy League Universities, and ran my own educational technology startup. Moving forward, I hope to use the skills I have acquired towards entrepreneurial endeavors in the medical field.</p>
